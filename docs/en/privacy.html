      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>

      <p>Hiroya Ishihara ("we", "us", or "our") respects user privacy and is committed to protecting personal information in HugConverter (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>Photo Library Access</h3>
      <p>The App requests access to your device's photo library to provide video conversion features. All video data accessed is processed locally on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.</p>

      <h3>Conversion History &amp; Statistics</h3>
      <p>The App stores statistical data such as conversion counts and conversion history on your device. This data is never sent externally.</p>

      <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
      <p>The free version of the App displays advertisements using Google AdMob. AdMob may use Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for personalized ad delivery. IDFA collection is performed only with user consent through the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.</p>
      <p>For Google AdMob's privacy practices, please refer to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
      <p>The App offers in-app purchases through Apple StoreKit. Payment information is processed by Apple, and we do not directly collect credit card or other payment information.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
      <p>All data generated by the App (conversion history, settings, statistics) is stored only on your device. No automatic synchronization to cloud servers is performed.</p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — Ad delivery</li>
        <li><strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> — In-app purchase processing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>All App data is deleted when you uninstall the App. Since no data is stored outside your device, uninstalling the App completely erases all data.</p>

      <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If significant changes are made, we will notify you through the App or this page.</p>

      <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
